## Abigail Kennedy

Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? 

- Our team structure seemed to work well since we were able to agree on most things and conflicts were short-lived. However, there seemed to be some communication issues where problems would come up and not be discussed until it was too late.
- On the technical side, the team did well with specializing in different areas while still being knowledgeable of everyone's work which was useful when combining work in the building and testing stage.

What unanticipated problems occurred? 

- There were several problems with our constraints or measures of success where we wouldn't be able to complete them, so we had to work with our advisor to modify them.
- The robot went slower than I expected which was part of my section, and I had to find was to test the robot to determine the root cause.

What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 

- I would have ensured we had better communication to know where everyone was at on their part of the project so we could all encourage and help one another more easily.

What “best practices” have you identified? 

- Document everything - especially in the testing phase - to make sure you aren't wasting time repeating tasks
- Be organized for documents and the project since it speeds up a lot of work

What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?

- Make sure to take your time in the planning phase and understand everything that you're doing
- Communicate everything with your team good and bad

What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.

- Team and project leadership
- Technical knowledge of motor control and mecanum wheel movement
- How to do electrical schematics
- How to give a good technical presentation
