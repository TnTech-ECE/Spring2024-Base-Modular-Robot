In this directory there are files for a SPICE simulation of the buck converter chip. The SPICE model of the buck converter was gotten from the manufacturer, Texas Instruments. To perform the simulation simply run the .asc file with LTSpice or another SPICE simulation software. There is only a simulation of the 3.3V layout, there was 5V layout originally but it was removed on accident some time ago. The only difference between the 3.3V and 5V simulations is a single resistor value, which can be easily determined in the datasheet. This is discussed more in the signoff for the power distribution system.
