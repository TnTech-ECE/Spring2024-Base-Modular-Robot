The two motor encoders will tell the low level microcontroller how fast the motor is driving, as well as the direction. These will be used in the path planning process.

Each motor will have a motor mount. The mount will attach to the motor by two screws. The motor and mount assembly will attach to the chassis by four screws. Please note that the chassis has not been designed yet, so the model does not show the final product, rather how the motor assebmly will be mounted.

The CAD model for the motor and wheel assembly can be found here.

## Analysis
### Acceleration

In order to traverse the entire playing field within the three minute time limit, the robot needs to move no slower than 0.0677 m\s. However, to allow for two minutes to complete the other tasks, the fastest velocity needed will be 0.2023 m/s. This would be the worst case scenario.

$v = 0.2023\ m/s$ 

$a = \frac{v - v_{o}}{t}$

$a = \frac{0.2023 - 0}{1}$

$a = 0.2032\ m/s^2$

### Force
#### Main Robot Weight
$W_{Motors} = 0.606\ kg_f$

$W_{ConsumptionParts} \approx  1.128\ kg_f$

$W_{Controllers} \approx 0.129\ kg_f$

$W_{Bolts} \approx 0.366\ kg_f$

$W_{Walls} \approx 1.669\ kg_f$

$W_{Power Supply} \approx 1\ kg_f$

$W_{Miscelaneous} \approx 4\ kg_f$

$\ $

#### Robot Caboose Weight
$W_{Ducks} = 0.708\ kg_f$

$W_{Pedestals} = 0.1442\ kg_f$

$W_{Walls} \approx 0.626\ kg_f$

$\ $

#### Total Weight

$W_{Total} \approx 10.376\ kg_f$

$M_{Total} \approx 1.0588\ kg_m$

$\ $

$\mu_{s} = 0.95$ (wood on rubber)

$\Sigma F_x = ma$

$F_n = mg = W_T$

$\Sigma F_x = F - (\mu_{s}F_n)$

$ma_x = F - (\mu_{s}F_n)$

$1.0588 * 0.2023 = F - (0.95 * 10.3762)$

$F = 10.07\ N$

$\ $

### Torque
$r = 0.024\ m$

$\tau_{total} = rFsin(\theta)$

$\tau_{total} = 0.024 * 10.07*sin(90^\degree)$

$\tau_{total} = 0.2417\ Nm$

$\tau_{motor} = \tau_{total} / 4 $

$\tau_{motor} = 0.0604 \ Nm$

$0.0604\ Nm = 6.149\ kgmm$

$\ $

The chosen motor is the Pololu #4865. It is a 12V medium power motor. The required torque for each motor is 6.149 kg-mm. This motor has a max efficiency at 8.6 kg-mm of torque. At 6.149 kg-mm of torque, the motor will operate at $\approx$ 70% of it's maximum efficiency. This motor choice will allow the torque requirments to be met while simultaneously achieving high efficiency. The motor draws 0.28 A. The L298N motor driver supplies 2A which is more than enough for this motor. The maximum torque of each motor is 40 kg-mm.


$6.149\ kgmm / 40\ kgmm = 15.34$\%

$100$\% $- 15.34$\% $= 84.66$\%

At the current torque requirment of 6.149 kg-mm of torque, only 15.34\% of the motor's torque capacity is being used. This allows for 84.66\% of each motor's torque capacity as the margin of safety.
