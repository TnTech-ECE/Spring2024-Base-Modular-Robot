### Orientation Signoff

## Functionality
The orientation signoff will provide the master control with the angle with respect to a certain position.
	This will aid with robot navigation when traversing an arena that does not have a line present.
	For future capstone teams, it will allow them to know what direction the robot is facing in order 
	to complete unique tasks.

## Constraints
### Derived from Shall Statements
- C4: The robot shall contain modules that are plug-and-play adaptable for different IEEE competition
	requirements.
	- This applies to the orientation subsystem because the sensors used may not be needed for
	future capstone teams' projects. The modules must be easily removable and replaceable.

- C9: The robot shall travel inclines and declines up to 25 degrees.
	- This constraint is applicable to the orientation subsystem because the system will be responsible for providing
		the master control with angle measurements. These angle measurements will aid the master control in sending
		the correct PWM signals to the motor drivers to traverse the incline at the optimal speed.
* C10: The robot shall turn 360 degrees left and right and move forwards and backwards based on sensor inputs.
* C11: The robot shall have a navigation system that controls movement.
	* The orientation subsystem will transmit data to the master control telling it where the robot is with respect to the
		starting position or zeroed position (explained in analysis).

### Derived from Broader Implications
	
- C14: The robot shall have a user manual that explains all functions and capabilities of the robot. 
	- This constraint will require all detailed design decisions to be documented and explained. Not only will the design have to be explained, but the motives behind the design and the other options explored so that future SECON teams have an understanding of why the design was created in a certain manner.
## Schematic



## Analysis
The Adafruit LSM6DSOX + LIS3MDL breakout board has the ST LSM6DSOX and ST LIS3MDL packaged on the
	same I2C device. This allows the orientation subsystem to obtain all needed data from one I2C 
	device. This attribute of the sensor set contributes to the plug-and-play adaptability constraint.
	If future teams choose not to use it, only one I2C device must be removed from the data bus.
	
Adafruit provides a generalized technical description on their webpage; therefore, the respective datasheets
	from ST will be used for analysis. 
### LSM6DSOX Accelerometer & Gyroscope
The LSM6DSOX 3D accelerometer and gyroscope will draw a maximum of
0.55 mA in the high-performance mode. The supply voltage has a range of 1.71 V to 3.6 V. The sensor module has 3 operating modes to help conserve power. This will not be of interest for this project since the orientation module needs to run at all times when it is enabled; however, future teams can program the module to be in low power modes to maximize efficiency. The power supply bus voltage of 3.3 V will suit the sensor. There is an on-chip regulator that will control supply voltage.

The module has 4 modes. The first mode is for connecting the sensor set to a single host using I2C. This is the mode that the base robot will be utilizing. The other three modes are for connecting the sensor set to both
the host and additional modules for dual communication. These modes will be documented in the robot's user manual so that future teams know the functionality possibilities of the senor module. The accelerometer 
and gyroscope provide the chip with 6 degrees of freedom to measure the orientation of the robot. ST gives a model of the measurement capabilities:

</p>

The module is capable of capturing the acceleration in the x,y, and z 		planes (top image). In addition to measuring the acceleration, it can also produce angle values shown in the bottom image. ST claims that the accelerometer is capable of measuring $\pm2\pm4\pm8\pm16$ g from 1.6 Hz to 6.7 kHz update rate. The gyroscope is capable of $\pm125\pm250\pm500\pm1000\pm2000$ degrees per second from 12.5 Hz to 6.7 kHz update rate. The update rate of 2 kHz will provide the master control with ample readings. At maximum speed, the sensor will read new data every 0.012 inches: 


$2 \frac{ft}{s}\cdot \frac{1}{2000s} = 0.001 ft \text{ or }0.012in$

The sensor set also allows for tilt detection, so when the robot is climbing up an incline and needs to increase power to the motors, the tilt detection can interrupt the routine to send the master control the angular data. 

### LIS3MDL Magnetometer (Compass) 
The LIS3MDL Magnetometer will draw a maximum of 270 $\mu A$ in high resolution mode. In low power mode, the sensor only draws 40 $\mu A$. The supply voltage is rated from 1.9 V to 3.6 V. The 3.3 V power supply will be able to supply a voltage within the acceptable range. The magnetometer is capable of measuring full scales of $\pm 4/ \pm 8/ \pm 12/ \pm 16$ gauss. The datasheet suggests that currents higher than 10 $mA$ cannot be near the sensor. The magnetic field generated by the current will contribute to the measured Earth field which will cause false readings. The suggested distance is a "few millimeters". The tray that holds the device will also help isolate the sensor set from the current-generated field.

## Robot Attachment
Ideally, the sensor needs to be mounted on a plane parallel to the robot. That is, the sensor orientation needs to mimic the robot's orientation. The sensor can be mounted on the interior of the robot. The sensor will be held by a 3D printed tray. Details on the tray configuration can be found in the chassis design signoffs.
