# Attachment Signoff

## Functionality

The function of the attachment subsystem is to hold components of other sybsystems in appropriate positions and orientations on the robot without hindering component operation. These attachments will also allow for easy customization of the robot for future teams through easy addition, removal, and adjustment capabilities. 

## Constraints

### Derived from Shall Statements

- C4: The robot shall contain modules that are plug and play adaptable for different IEEE competition requirements.
	- This constraint is applicable to the attachment subsystem because components need to have the ability to be added, removed, and or moved easily.

### Derived from Socioeconomic Impacts

- The components will be 3D printed to reduce cost of project. 	
	- It is important that costs are reduced because the project is aimed at being recreated each year. Therefore, the lowest possible cost without reducing robot performance is a goal for the team. 
		
### Derived from Specifications
- S1: The line sensor attachment must be designed to place the sensor between 0.125 and 0.375 inches off the ground.
	- This is derived from manufacturing specifications for proper operation of the line sensor. 
	
## Buildable Schematics

### Line Following Sensor
The line following sensor comes in an 8 sensor set that is broken along a preforated line that splits the sensor into a 6 sensor set and a 2 sensor set. Therefore, an attachment will created for each. The buildable schematic for each is seen below. The attachment for both is comprized of two peices that will be connected through a screw and washer to allow for height adjustment from the minimum to maximum recommended heights of 0.125 - 0.375 inches.
