# Experimental Analysis

## Introduction 

### Requirements

| Item | Constraint/Specification | Subsystem | 
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Shall design a robot with a single start button. Once activated, the robot will begin navigating its environment. | Power |
| 2 | Shall design a robot that possesses an allocated data input point for an alternative start method. | |
| 3 | Shall design an autonomous robot that has customizable dimensions with the stock design only occupying up to one-half of the allowed cubic foot (1 ft x 1 ft x 6 in). | Chassis |
| 4 | Shall design a robot platform whose modules are plug-and-play adaptable for different IEEE competition requirements.  | Chassis, Attachments, Navigation|
| 5 | Shall design a robot that possesses a robust, centralized charging system that does not require the removal of the battery and that allows the robot to be used while being charged. | Battery Management |
| 6 | Shall evaluate wireless charging as an option for charging the robot. | Wireless Charging|
| 7 | Shall design a robot to possess a single emergency stop button that is accessible and stops all robot movement without removing power to essential processors. | Power |
| 8 | Shall design the power bus in such a way that the DC motors do not inhibit robot operation. | Power |
| 9 | Shall design a robot that can travel inclines and declines up to 22.5 degrees.  | Motors |
| 10 | Shall design a robot that can turn 360 degrees left and right and move forwards and backwards based on sensor inputs. | Motors |
| 11 | Shall design a robot whose navigation system controls movement; knows its location within a two-inch tolerance; and possesses a maximum speed of 2 feet per second. | Navigation, Location, Motors|
