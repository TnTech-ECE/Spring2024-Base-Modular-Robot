# Experimental Analysis

## Introduction 

### Requirements

| Item | Constraint/Specification | Subsystem | 
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Shall design a robot with a single start button. Once activated, the robot will begin navigating its environment. | Power |
| 2 | Shall design a robot that possesses an allocated data input point for an alternative start method. | |
| 3 | Shall design an autonomous robot that has customizable dimensions with the stock design only occupying up to one-half of the allowed cubic foot (1 ft x 1 ft x 6 in). | Chassis |
| 4 | Shall design a robot platform whose modules are plug-and-play adaptable for different IEEE competition requirements.  | Chassis, Attachments, Navigation|
| 5 | Shall design a robot that possesses a robust, centralized charging system that does not require the removal of the battery and that allows the robot to be used while being charged. | Battery Management |
| 6 | Shall evaluate wireless charging as an option for charging the robot. | Wireless Charging|
| 7 | Shall design a robot to possess a single emergency stop button that is accessible and stops all robot movement without removing power to essential processors. | Power |
| 8 | Shall design the power bus in such a way that the DC motors do not inhibit robot operation. | Power |
| 9 | Shall design a robot that can travel inclines and declines up to 22.5 degrees.  | Motors |
| 10 | Shall design a robot that can turn 360 degrees left and right and move forwards and backwards based on sensor inputs. | Motors |
| 11 | Shall design a robot whose navigation system controls movement; knows its location within a two-inch tolerance; and possesses a maximum speed of 2 feet per second. | Navigation, Location, Motors|
| 12 | The attachment components will be 3D printed to reduce cost of project. 	| Attachments, Layout and Organization |
| 13 | The line sensor attachment must be designed to place the sensor between 0.125 and 0.375 inches off the ground. | Attachments | 
| 14 | The frame will need to be able to withstand 20 pounds. | Chassis |

## Results

### Constraint 1 - Start Button

### Constraint 2 - Alternate Start Method 

### Constraint 3 - Dimensions
The dimensions of the robot are customizable when ordering the extruded alumnium for future teams. The extruded alumnium can be cut to change the dimensions. Additionally, the stock design only takes up the specified 1 ft x 1 ft x 6 in area shown below. This constraint could not be experimentally tested because it is inherently true.

#### Length (12 in)
