# Documentation

Each of the folders have the team's designs, research, and useful images used for the project. It also contains the team's meeting notes and plans for the future of the project. A final BOM was determined after purchasing everything for this iteration.

## Signoffs

Signoffs are the detailed part of the design process which includes the schematics, bill of materials, specifications, and justifications. The signoffs have been approved by Dr. Nan Chen and were also advised by Dr. Jessee Roberts.
