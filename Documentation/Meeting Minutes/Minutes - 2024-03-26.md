## Team Member Updates

Team members continued working on experimental analysis (EA).

## Action Items from Last Meeting

Discuss with Dr. Chen about expectations for the EA.

## Meeting Minutes

Dr Chen said it is acceptable to only test using the existing 22.5 degree incline.

Dr. Chen wants robot to ideally be able to maneuver around obstacles. Don't need to do 2 boards, but if can demo obstacle maneuvering and line following on one board, that is acceptable. Location within 2 inch tolerance too.

For user manual, it is acceptable to just show Dr. Chen what we have with the user manual for the EA deadline.

For capacitive power transfer, it is acceptable to provide plans/ideas for future teams to expand on the system from where the system is now.

Discussed doing meeting next Thursday instead of Tuesday. 

## Action Items for Next Meeting

Go over progress on EA. Discuss with Roberts about EA expectations.

## Member Assignments

Continue working on EA.
