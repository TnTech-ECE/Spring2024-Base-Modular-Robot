## Team Member Updates

Discussed with Roberts about several points on Monday and in class on Wednesday.

Everything needing to be in ROS.\
No, we can have some in Arduino.

Vin pin being ok with 5V.\
It is probably fine.

Speed not being 2 ft/s.\
Should debug and try to find out why it is not hitting 2 ft/s and fix it. If not, at least have a hypothesis for why it is not reaching that speed.

Emergency Stop Button Height.\
Try putting button on its side. Can also use another button that is not safety rated but stays pressed.

Technical Presentation Due Data.\
Current due date should be correct with the extra snow week, but the date can be debated if there is a reason for it.
