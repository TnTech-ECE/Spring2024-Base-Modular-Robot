## Team Member Updates

Team members continued working on subsystems for experimental analysis (EA).

Isaac H:\
One of the line sensors stopped working, started sending all zeros. Something may have gotten shorted when thing were being moved. Otherwise, sensor readout is working and have some communication between sensors, arduinos, and jetson nano. Figured out why I2C sensors werent working - They were sending 3.3 V signals, but receiving 5 V signals. Moving everything over to 3.3 V rails fixed it.

Mabel:\
Updated sensor attachments and sent to makerspace. Worked on user manual.

Luke:\
Worked on manual, tested the twisted pair cable which seems to not work. Got a basic CPT setup working, need to ask Roberts how far need need to go with the CPT setup. Finished manual as well.

Abigail:\
Worked more on motor code for communication and got steering working. Will work more on motor code.

Isaac J:\
Worked on getting comms working, motor comm almost works. Sensor communication working.

Reid:\
Picked out locations for measurements for EA,
