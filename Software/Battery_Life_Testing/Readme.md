The arduino file in this directory was used to record the battery voltage data over a 38 minute period. When run, it toggles a BJT connected to the power board and a DC power supply to emulate connecting and disconnecting the power board from a battery. It writes the voltage recorded on the analog in pin (used to record the 5 V bus) and the cycle number that it was recorded at to an SD card. When the voltage drops below a certain threshold, the arduino writes the cycle number that it occurred at to a different file on the SD card. This program was used to estimate the battery voltage, and more about it can be found in the power manual.
