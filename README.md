# Modular IEEE Robot

## Executive Summary

Each year, Tennessee Technological University (Tech) participates in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Southeastern Conference (SECON) hardware competition. The competition asks participants to create a robot that can perform various tasks, and competitors are scored based on their robot’s capability to complete tasks as quickly as possible. In past years, Tech has placed well, but the same problems have arisen each year that have inhibited wins: choppy navigation, shorted cables, and battery depletion are just a few of the many problems teams have repeatedly faced in previous competitions. The team sets out to fix the besetting problems that teams face each year not by competing in SECON, but rather by building a generalized platform that will optimize the basic robotic functionality for future teams. Sensing, movement, and centralized charging are the top priorities in the team’s design, all fitted together in a modular, adaptable framework that can be manipulated to fit most – if not all – IEEE hardware competition specifications. No longer will teams have to spend countless hours learning and designing movement systems or hoping everything works after rewiring a battery mid-competition. The design will take care of these basic competition necessities and leave the custom tailoring to the competition team.

## About Us

### Team
- Year, major, minor(s), interests, what you did on project

**[Luke Chapman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-chapman-/)** is an electrical engineering major at Tennessee Technological University with a minor in mathematics. He is interested in electromagnetics, telecommunications, and signal processing. Luke is responsible for the power management and distribution systems of the robot as well as the experimental wireless power charging system.

**[Reid Crews](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackson-crews-381187257/)** is an electrical engineering major, mechatronics concentration at Tennessee Technological University with a minor in mathematics. Reid's interests are mechatronics and control systems. For the project, Reid is a contributor for the navigation sensing, primarily the location and object detection subsystems.

**[Isaac Hoese](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-hoese-425748251)** is a senior electrical engineering student from Greeneville, Tn. He is interested in both power system analysis and embedded system design. In this project, Isaac will be a contributor for the navigation sensing, primarily the line following and orientation subsystems.

**Isaac Jennings**

**[Abigail Kennedy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abigail-kennedy-tech/)** is an electrical engineering major at Tennessee Technological University with minors in mathematics and education. Abigail's primary interest is in controls and PLC design, and for this project, she worked on the motor control subsystem to ensure the robot can move quickly and smoothly.

**[Mabel Olson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mabelolson/)** is an electrical engineering major at Tennessee Technological University with a minor in mathematics. She is intrested in power and control systems. In this project, Mabel is responsible for the chassis design, robot layout, organization, and any 3D designing of component attachment pieces. 


### Faculty Supervisor

The faculty supervisor for this project is [Dr. Nan Chen][def1]. She completed her electrical and control engineering Bachelor's degree from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. She also completed her Master's and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Waterloo.

### Stakeholders

The primary customer for the project is [Professor Jesse Roberts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessetnroberts/) - the advisor for the IEEE SECON hardware teams. Future teams are impacted by this design but unable to be stakeholders, so he gives input on their behalf based on his years of experience with the competition.


### Recognitions

We would like to recognize and thank Professor Jesse Roberts, Dr. Nan Chen, and Dr. Charles Van Neste for their continuous input and guidance on the project.
