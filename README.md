# Modular IEEE Robot

## Executive Summary

Each year, Tennessee Technological University (Tech) participates in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Southeastern Conference (SECON) hardware competition. The competition asks participants to create a robot that can perform various tasks, and competitors are scored based on their robot’s capability to complete tasks as quickly as possible. In past years, Tech has placed well, but the same problems have arisen each year that have inhibited wins: choppy navigation, shorted cables, and battery depletion are just a few of the many problems teams have repeatedly faced in previous competitions. The team sets out to fix the besetting problems that teams face each year not by competing in SECON, but rather by building a generalized platform that will optimize the basic robotic functionality for future teams. Sensing, movement, and centralized charging are the top priorities in the team’s design, all fitted together in a modular, adaptable framework that can be manipulated to fit most – if not all – IEEE hardware competition specifications. No longer will teams have to spend countless hours learning and designing movement systems or hoping everything works after rewiring a battery mid-competition. The design will take care of these basic competition necessities and leave the custom tailoring to the competition team.
